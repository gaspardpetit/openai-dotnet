# OpenAI Documentation Examples for .NET

## Running the Samples

The samples use a new .NET 10 feature that allows [running single C# file applications](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-dotnet-run-app/). Each file in this folder is a standalone application. 

To run them, you need to install the .NET 10 preview. 

Then, from the command line, you can run them using the `dotnet run <sample_name>` command, for example: `dotnet run s1-chat_simpleprompt.cs`.
